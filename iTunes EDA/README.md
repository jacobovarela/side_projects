# iTunes EDA

---

### Problem
I recently bought a new laptop with limited storage, and I just migrated my large (over 150GB) iTunes library to it. I need to free up some space and I know that I have a lot of un-listened and unwanted music.

### EDA
The goal of this "project" is to take a peek at my 10-year old music library and do the following:
- Understand the composition (most listened to artists, albums, songs) of my iTunes library.
- Identify the songs that I will not be listening to any time soon.

### Clean library
Hopefully, by the end of the analysis I will be able to remove all unwanted music from my iTunes library in order to free space in my hard drive.

### Target
To eliminate 50GB of music, and not regret it.
